# TODO
### To don't forget

**Projects page**
- Change the border to be the project color -> That could be fix _cf. **Border**_
- Same on OhMyPi, need to reset everything on each change (some bugs on rapid change)
- Projects image in div data **????**
**Border**
- Let's replace the border using box-shadow (perhaps??) to 4 div with *classes* and **id**:
  - **borders**: *border* container
  - *border*: *border* style (color)
  - *horizontal|vertical*: *border* width & height
  - *left|right|top|bottom*: *border* positions
**Project**
- SVG height isn't automatic
  - The problem can be solved by using another mask dimension, defining another viewbox for the big computer in #mockups
- Responsive
- Sitemap

### Partialy fixed but still issues
**Loader**
- Fix loading issues
